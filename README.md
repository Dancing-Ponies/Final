<h2>Summary</h2>
The program we created is called Animal Games. There is a total of six forms for our five mini games. Our first game is called Pets Owned, this program asks a series of questions and then averages how many total pets there are between you and your friends! Our second game is a horse race, there are five horses and when you click they race, it keeps score for each horse and you can race as many times as you want. Our third game is called lions, tigers, bears and it is very similar to rock, paper, scissors. There are animal sounds for when whatever animal you pick. Our fourth game is a game of luck, you click a button and the computer randomly generates an animal and sentence about the animal. Our fifth game is a series of questions and you enter your favorite animals. we had a couple problems with learning how to code for sound, and remembering loops and such. 
<h3>Installations</h3> 
You need to install visual studio to access our program, and our program is linked through github.
<h3>Tests</h3>
The main test we ran was just debugging our code. The debugging tells us is our code has any errors because our program cannot function correctly with any errors. Our coding style was the one we were taught in class for visual basic, such as naming buttons "btn". 
<h3>Deployment</h3>
